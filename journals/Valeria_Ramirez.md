Today we agreed to work with multiple databases instead of one, after drawing our wireframe we each worked on a microservice. We decided on PostgreSQL to set up our databases and learned that dividing up our microservices will make it easier to comprehend when writing our code. We're planning to use these services to allow users to search for flights, hotels, activities, and to make bookings. We made progress and am looking to making more!

Delante helped us with the many to many between truckss and activities. Later we learned from riley that nested routes would be easier, in our case setting trips first and the rest of our services after. Then we created our migations and spread them into 5 different files
